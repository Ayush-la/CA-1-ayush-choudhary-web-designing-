            This iconic oil painting by **Vincent van Gogh** depicts the view from the east-facing window
            of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an
            imaginary village. It's often considered Van Gogh's *magnum opus*.

            One of the most recognized is his Self-Portrait with a Beret (1886), where his face is captured with the characteristic loose, vibrant brushwork of Impressionism.
            s a central figure in Impressionism, his main focus was on landscape and light, making his introspective <u>self potrait</u> a rare and fascinating glimpse of the artist himself.
            during the Renaissance. The subject's <del>controversial</del> enigmatic
            smile continues to fascinate viewers centuries later.

            Painted in late 1903 during his Blue Period, the canvas is dominated by shades of blue and depicts a hunched, haggard, and presumably blind elderly man clutching his guitar. The work powerfully conveys themes of human misery, poverty, and isolation, with the guitar's warm brown color offering the only counterpoint to the despairing blue, suggesting that art is his only solace and dignity.

            His self-portraits are characterized by intense color and bold, visible brushstrokes, offering an unvarnished view into his fluctuating mental and emotional states.
            These paintings were essential to his practice, allowing him to save money on models and intensely explore his own identity and suffering.

            <img src="the-scream.jpg" alt="A figure holding their head on a bridge against a swirling red sky." width="350" height="450"><br>
            *The Scream* is a work from **Edvard Munch's** series, *The Frieze of Life*.
            The androgynous figure, a symbol of modern anxiety, is a powerful expression of existential
            angst. Munch recorded in his diary that he was walking at sunset when he "felt a great
            scream pass through nature."
